# Hungarian algorithm application in C
<p align="justify">
This project aims to implement the hungarian algorithm in c as a way to solve the assignment problem by calculating the maximum sum of elements from a selected matrix, included in the mat.txt file, where only one element is chosen per row and column. This algorithm works with any matrix, be it square or not, as the first step happens to be squaring the matrix itself by adding zeros in the missing columns/rows.

The project includes detailed doxygen generated documentation for ease of use and understanding.

## Key features

  - Efficient implementation of the hungarian algorithm;
  - Maximum sum calculation;
  - Ability to add or remove rows and columns dynamically;
  - Works with any matrices;
  - Clear, step-by-step breakdown of the algorithm;
  - Doxygen documentation.


## How to use

  1. Compile the code using any c compiler.
  2. In order to try different matrices input the desired matrix in the 'mat.txt' file and modify the rows and columns parameters to fit your matrix.

```ruby
  4,5,
  6,7,
  7,10,
rows:3
cols:2
```

- The matrix should be comma-separated and formatted as shown.
